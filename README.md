# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
Module 10 Challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.
Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data. You will find my code in the 'SurfsUp' folder under 'SQLAlchemy-Challenge.ipynb'. 
I have uploaded both my barchart for yearly precipitation and my histogram for yearly temperature observation under Barchart.png and Histogram.png respectively.
Part 2: Design Your Climate App. My code for this is in the 'SurfsUp' folder under 'app.py'.
Resources: Xpert Learning Assistant for overall debugging and coding issues. 
EdEx provided the Resources and reference folders: References:
